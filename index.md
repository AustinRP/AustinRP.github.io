I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Broadly, I do research in datacenter networking under [Prof. Eric Rozner](http://ericrozner.com/) as part of the CU Boulder Interconnected Systems and Optimized Networks (BISON) Lab. We are part of the [Networking and Security Research (NSR) group](http://nsr.colorado.edu/) and the [Computer Systems group](https://systems.cs.colorado.edu/). In May 2017, I received my BS in Computer Science from the University of South Carolina. After graduation, I worked as an Implementation Consultant for [FAST Enterprises](https://www.fastenterprises.com/) in Nashville, Tennessee.

Currently, I am doing research related to virtualization and cloud streaming services like [Google Stadia](https://stadia.dev) and [Puffin OS](https://www.puffin.com/os/).
